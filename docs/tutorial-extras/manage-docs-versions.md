# Creating Content


## Listings

On the left-hand side of the ‘Create Content’ page is the Listings section. This displays the listing you have chosen to create content on as well as allows you to add other properties as tiles using the <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image15.png').default}/> button at the bottom right hand corner of the page. You can have a maximum of five listings in the panel. This saves the listings you have chosen as well as the content generated for you as shown:
 <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image16.png').default}/>

## Create Content

The ‘Create content’ panel in the middle is divided into three sections. 
 - Content Type: <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image17.png').default}/>This section allows you to select the type of content you want to be generated using the selection button. 
 - Initial Prompt: This text box has a default prompt, however you can type any prompt into the box to achieve more accurate results tailored to your needs.
    * Drop-Down menu: <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image18.png').default}/> The drop-down menu allows you to select a theme/mood, eg. funny, professional, casual, etc.
    * Generate From Prompt:<img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image19.png').default}/> This button will produce a response with all of your given selections.
    * Randomize: <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image20.png').default}/>The Randomise button will generate your response with a different theme/mood each time.
 - Generated Responses: 

The generated responses section will show all of the responses you have generated for the particular listing. Once a response is generated it will display as such: 
<img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image21.png').default}/>

There are three buttons given in each response panel:
  * <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image22.png').default}/>: The ‘Regenerate’ button will generate a different response  with the exact specifications given for that particular output.
  * <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image23.png').default}/>: The ‘Copy’ button will copy the text to clipboard.
  * <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image24.png').default}/>:The ‘Choose this Generated Content’ button will display that particular response in the Preview Panel on the right side of the page.


## Preview

The preview panel on the right side of the page will display the most recent generated content, unless otherwise chosen. The content will be displayed in the format/style of the selected social media and content type.
