# SERHANT A.I Chat 
This page operates through starting a chat by asking questions in the text box at the bottom of the page and then receiving a response from SGPT. The page has three prompts <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image25.png').default}/> designed to start a chat and provoke you to ask questions. 

Once an answer is generated a response will be shown as such. You are able to ask follow up questions as well as ‘Copy’ the generated response using the button <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image23.png').default}/>.
