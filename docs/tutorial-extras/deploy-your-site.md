# SERHANT A.I Image Editor

This page allows you to edit and enhance images through different filters. There are two modes; **Basic** and **Advanced**, that allow you to apply different filters to the stock images provided or upload your own images from your desktop. This can be done through dragging the image and dropping it in the box provided on the page or using the ‘Upload image’<img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image29.png').default}/> button. Once you have selected an image four buttons in the top-right of the page will appear <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image30.png').default}/>.

 - <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image31.png').default}/>: The ‘Undo’ button will undo the last change you made to an image.

 - <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image32.png').default}/>: The ‘Download’ button will download the content with any edits or filters applied. It will download the latest version of the image you have created.

 - <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image33.png').default}/>: The ‘Upload’ button allows you to upload a new image. 

## Basic Filters
The basic filters allow you to select from the given options, Baroque, Neoclassical, Victorian, etc, and apply that style to the image. 

## Advanced Filters
The advanced filters have more editing options and will save your selections as presets in the Basic Filter tab. The advanced filters have numerous filters which you can adjust to achieve the edit style you want. 

After you have selected the desired settings click the ‘Generate’ button <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image34.png').default}/> to apply this to the image. To reset all filters back to the default setting click the <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image35.png').default}/> button. To save the preset scroll to the top and click the <img src={require('C:/Users/bhola/UserGuide/image36.png').default}/> button. A dialogue box will open allowing you to name the preset and confirm your filter choices. Once the preset is saved you can go back to the Basic Filter tab to see your custom preset with a thumbnail under the ‘Saved preset’ Section.
